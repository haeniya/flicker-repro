# React Native Navigation Flicker on Android

When navigating to a screen outside of the Tab Navigator, the screen is flickering on the right side on Android. On iOS I don't see the issue.

Flickering is not very well visible in the GIF but you can see it when I'm going to the Settings screen after the Explore screen again.

It only happens on a real device with a proper build (dev build or preview build).

It happens with both animations shift or none.
